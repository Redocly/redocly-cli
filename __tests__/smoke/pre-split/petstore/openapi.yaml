    # Introduction

    This API is documented in **OpenAPI format** and is based on

    [Petstore sample](http://petstore.swagger.io/) provided by
    [swagger.io](http://swagger.io) team.

    It was **extended** to illustrate features of
    [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo)

    tool and [ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) documentation. In
    addition to standard

    OpenAPI syntax we use a few [vendor
    extensions](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).


    # OpenAPI Specification

    This API is documented in **OpenAPI format** and is based on

    [Petstore sample](http://petstore.swagger.io/) provided by
    [swagger.io](http://swagger.io) team.

    It was **extended** to illustrate features of

    # Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

    This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in
    compliance with  [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).

    And that allows cross-domain communication from the browser.

    All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public
    and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.


    # Authentication


    Petstore offers two forms of authentication:
      - API Key
      - OAuth2
    OAuth2 - an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple

    and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.
