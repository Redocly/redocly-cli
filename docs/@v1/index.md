# Redocly CLI

Redocly CLI is an open source command-line tool for working with OpenAPI descriptions, developer portals, and other API lifecycle operations including API linting, enhancement, and bundling.

`redocly` brings together the open source goodness with the rest of the Redocly offerings.
Authenticate, update APIs, publish documentation, and use the other tools to manage, polish and share the APIs throughout the API lifecycle.
