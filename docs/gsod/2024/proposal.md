# Google Season of Docs 2024 - Redocly proposal

[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) provides support for open-source projects to improve their documentation and gives professional technical writers an opportunity to gain experience in open source.
Together we raise awareness of open source, of docs, and of technical writing.

Redocly is applying to participate in Google Season of Docs 2024.

## About Redocly

[Redocly](https://redocly.com/) was founded in 2017 with the mission to get more consumers using APIs with less hands-on support.
We were born out of [Redoc](https://redocly.com/docs/redoc/), the popular open-source OpenAPI documentation software project used by thousands of companies worldwide.
We make API design and documentation software with the goal to accelerate API ubiquity.
Our suite of products makes our customersâ€™ APIs more accessible and loved by their end users and consumers.

## How to apply

We are glad you are interested in contributing to Redocly's open source project documentation.
Please send your [statement of interest](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-statement) to [gsod@redocly.com](mailto:gsod@redocly.com) by April 26th.

Be sure to review the skills needed for each project and include references to your abilities in these areas in particular.

You also need to be able to meet remotely within the US East Coast and EU time zones.

## Project ideas

Our open-source tools allow developer teams to create clean, accessible documentation to complement their APIs.
By making sure that the project documentation is complete, accurate, and up-to-date, community contributors can add immense value to our open-source projects.

The following are the open source projects we would like some help with:

- [Redocly CLI](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-cli): Redocly CLI is an open source command-line tool for working with OpenAPI descriptions, developer portals, and other API lifecycle operations including API linting, enhancement, and bundling.
- [OpenAPI starter](https://github.com/Redocly/openapi-starter): OpenAPI starter is a template repository that you can use to start your own OpenAPI project.

To contribute to or discuss the project ideas, create a GSOD project ideas issue on the [redocly-cli repo](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-cli/tree/main) in GitHub.
