# Update Redocly CLI

If you've already installed Redocly CLI, you'll want to keep it as up to date as possible. Staying on top of versions ensures that you get the latest functionality and bug fixes.

If you [installed Redocly CLI globally](../installation.md), run this command:

```shell Command
npm i -g @redocly/cli@latest
```

You can check your version by running `redocly --version`.
