# Migrate to Redocly CLI from openapi-cli

This is the best upgrade path ever:

- replace all instances of `openapi-cli` with `redocly`

... that's it. The project and command were renamed, but everything else should just work.

There are some new features in Redocly CLI, so [visit the main docs](../index.md) and see if there's anything you'd like to add to your own workflows.
