# Manage the lint configuration

The `lint` configuration section is part of the [Redocly configuration file](../configuration/configuration-file.mdx).
The `lint` and `bundle` commands use this section to control various options.

The Redocly configuration file supports global lint settings (configured in the top-level `lint` section) and per-API lint settings (configured in the `lint` sections for individual APIs).

```yaml
apis:
  main@v1:
    root: ./openapi/openapi.yaml
    lint:
      rules: []
      (...)
lint:
  rules: []
  (...)
```

If `lint` section is not defined for an API, global settings are used.
If `lint` is defined for an API, its settings apply together with the global configuration.
If per-API and global sections modify the same properties, per-API settings will override global settings.

The `lint` configuration section consists of several sub-sections. The following code block shows an example `lint` section. Sub-sections are described further in the text.

```yaml
lint:
  plugins:
    - './local-plugin.js'
  extends:
    - recommended
  rules:
    no-sibling-refs:
      severity: error
    boolean-parameter-prefixes:
      severity: error
      prefixes: ['should', 'is', 'has']
  ...
```

:::attention Per-API support

The `lint` section only supports `rules` and `decorators` sub-sections when used per-API.

You can't use `plugins` in per-API settings.

:::


## Sub-sections

### Plugins

Use this section to import local plugins. If you don't have any custom plugins, omit this section.

* **type**: `array of strings`

:::warning

You don't need to import built-in plugins and rules.

Community plugins are not supported.

:::

#### Examples

```yaml Import a single plugin
lint:
  plugins:
    - './local-plugin.js'
```

```yaml Import multiple plugins
lint:
  plugins:
    - ['./local-plugin.js', './another-local-plugin.js']
```

### Extends

Use this section to choose the base configuration for further extension or adding your own plugins. You may override specific settings in the subsequent sections.

* **type**: `array of strings`
* **default**: `recommended`
* **possible values**: `minimal`, `recommended`, `all`

Possible values specified above are related to built-in rules only. Custom plugins can contain additional configurations, so it can be as follows:

```yaml
lint:
  extends:
    - recommended
    - my-custom-super-ruleset
```

Find more information in the [Configs in plugins](../resources/custom-rules.md#configs-in-plugins) section.


#### Examples

```yaml Single value
lint:
  extends:
    - minimal
```

```yaml Multiple values
lint:
  extends:
    - minimal
    - recommended
```


### Preprocessors

As preprocessors are rarely indicated, you can omit this section in most cases.

* **type**: `array of objects`
* **possible values**: `error`, `warn`, `off`

Preprocessors run first during `lint` and `bundle`.

:::info

For the `bundle` command, linting happens only when the `--lint` flag is used.

:::

### Rules

Use this section to change the [severity level](#severity-levels) of any rules in your extended configurations. Some rules may also receive [additional configurations](#additional-rule-options).

* **type**: `array of objects`
* **possible values**: `error`, `warn`, `off`

For `lint` command: rules run *after* preprocessors.
For `bundle` command: rules run *between* preprocessors and decorators.

#### Examples

```yaml Short syntax
lint:
  rules:
    no-sibling-refs: error
```

```yaml Verbose syntax
lint:
  rules:
    no-sibling-refs:
      severity: error
```

```yaml Rules with additional configuration
# Use verbose configuration syntax to define additional configuration
# The boolean-parameter-prefixes example overrides the default "prefixes".
lint:
  rules:
    boolean-parameter-prefixes:
      severity: error
      prefixes: ['should', 'is', 'has']
```

### Decorators

Use this section to enable or disable decorators. They modify the definition in the bundling process after validation is complete. If you don't use decorators, omit this section.

* **type**: `array of objects`
* **possible values**: `error`, `warn`, `off`

For `bundle` command: decorators run *after* linting.

:::info

For the `bundle` command, linting happens only when the `--lint` flag is used.

:::

### Severity levels

* **applied to**: [`preprocessors`](#preprocessors), [`rules`](#rules), [`decorators`](#decorators)
* **possible values**: `error`, `warn`, `off`

#### Examples

With the short configuration syntax, you can't configure [additional options](#additional-rule-options) for any given rule (if it supports them).

```yaml Short syntax
lint:
  extends:
    - recommended
  rules:
    boolean-parameter-prefixes: warn
    no-unused-components: error
```

```yaml Verbose syntax
lint:
  extends:
    - recommended
  rules:
    boolean-parameter-prefixes:
      severity: warn
    no-unused-components:
      severity: error
```

:::info

See the [rules documentation](../resources/built-in-rules.md) for more information.

:::

### Additional rule options

The example below shows additional rule options for the `boolean-parameter-prefixes` rule:

```yaml
lint:
  extends:
    - recommended
  rules:
    boolean-parameter-prefixes:
      severity: warn
      prefixes: ["can", "has", "is", "should"]
    no-unused-components:
      severity: error
```

To know which rules support options, read the [built-in rules documentation](../resources/built-in-rules.md).

:::success Tip

If you write custom rules, you may create rules that accept additional configuration options as well.
Be sure to document those options for your users.

:::

### Different OpenAPI versions

Redocly OpenAPI CLI supports OpenAPI versions 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1. Most of the time you will use one of them. However, you may need to configure different rules based on the version. You can do that by using additional configuration sections:

```yaml
lint:
  extends:
    - recommended
  rules:
    boolean-parameter-prefixes: warn
    no-unused-components: error
  oas2Rules:
    no-unused-components: off
  oas3_0Rules:
    boolean-parameter-prefixes: error
```

In this example, the OpenAPI specification version is identified:

* If it is version 2 (formerly known as Swagger), it will prioritize the `oas2Rules` section.
* If it is version 3 (OpenAPI 3.x), it will prioritize the `oas3_0Rules` section.

:::info

If the version is not defined, it will fall back to the `rules` section.

:::

Read more about [built-in rules](../resources/built-in-rules.md).

### Resolve JSON references ($refs)

The OpenAPI specification supports `$refs` in some of the objects. In practice, different tools and implementations of the OAS, as well as API definition authors, may use or even require `$refs` in unsupported places.

Starting from version `beta-30` onward, OpenAPI CLI automatically resolves all `$refs` by default, even in places where they are not allowed by the specification. This includes primitive values, for example `string`, in description and examples fields.

To disable resolving `$refs` in examples, use the `doNotResolveExamples` configuration option in the `lint` section of the Redocly configuration file. This does not affect `$ref` resolution in other parts of the API definition:

```yaml
lint:
  doNotResolveExamples: true
  extends:
    - recommended
  rules:
    (...)
```
