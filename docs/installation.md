```shell
openapi --version

```

## Runtime installation

### npx

:::info
`npx` is npm's package runner. It will install and run a command at the same time without installing it globally.
:::

```shell command
npx @redocly/openapi-cli <command> [options]
```

```shell example with lint command
npx @redocly/openapi-cli@latest lint petstore.yaml
```

```shell output (lint failed)
npx @redocly/openapi-cli@latest lint petstore.yaml

### Docker

To give the Docker container access to the OpenAPI definition files, you need to mount the containing directory as a volume. Assuming the OAS definition is rooted in the current working directory, the command will be the following:

```shell example with lint command
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/spec redocly/openapi-cli lint petstore.yaml
```

## Post-installation

### Set up tab completion

To set up tab completion for the terminal, generate the completion script with the command:

```shell command
openapi completion
```

```shell output
###-begin-openapi-completions-###
#
# yargs command completion script
#
# Installation: /Users/gold/.npm/_npx/b36cbb32e525fe97/node_modules/.bin/openapi completion >> ~/.bashrc
#    or /Users/gold/.npm/_npx/b36cbb32e525fe97/node_modules/.bin/openapi completion >> ~/.bash_profile on OSX.
#
_openapi_yargs_completions()
{
    local cur_word args type_list

    cur_word="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"
    args=("${COMP_WORDS[@]}")

    # ask yargs to generate completions.
    type_list=$(/Users/gold/.npm/_npx/b36cbb32e525fe97/node_modules/.bin/openapi --get-yargs-completions "${args[@]}")

    COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "${type_list}" -- ${cur_word}) )

    # if no match was found, fall back to filename completion
    if [ ${#COMPREPLY[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
      COMPREPLY=()
    fi

    return 0
}
complete -o default -F _openapi_yargs_completions openapi
###-end-openapi-completions-###
```

The command output contains installation instructions. For example, to install the completion script in `bash`, use:

```shell command
openapi completion >> ~/.bashrc
```

The approach is similar for other shells. After the installation, restart your terminal for changes to take effect.
