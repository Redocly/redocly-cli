```shell Command
npx @redocly/cli <command> [options]
```

```shell Example with lint command
npx @redocly/cli@latest lint petstore.yaml
```

```shell Output (lint failed)
npx @redocly/cli@latest lint petstore.yaml

### Docker

To give a Docker container access to your OpenAPI definition files, you need to mount the containing directory as a volume. Assuming the definition is rooted in the current working directory, the command to use is:

```shell Example with lint command
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/spec redocly/openapi-cli lint petstore.yaml
```

```shell Output (lint succeeded)

## Set up tab completion (optional)

After a successful install, you can set up tab completion for the terminal if you wish. Generate the completion script using the following command:

```shell Command
redocly completion
```

```shell Output
###-begin-openapi-completions-###
#
# yargs command completion script
#
# Installation: /Users/gold/.npm/_npx/b36cbb32e525fe97/node_modules/.bin/openapi completion >> ~/.bashrc
#    or /Users/gold/.npm/_npx/b36cbb32e525fe97/node_modules/.bin/openapi completion >> ~/.bash_profile on OSX.
#
_openapi_yargs_completions()
{
    local cur_word args type_list

    cur_word="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"
    args=("${COMP_WORDS[@]}")

    # ask yargs to generate completions.
    type_list=$(/Users/gold/.npm/_npx/b36cbb32e525fe97/node_modules/.bin/openapi --get-yargs-completions "${args[@]}")

    COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "${type_list}" -- ${cur_word}) )

    # if no match was found, fall back to filename completion
    if [ ${#COMPREPLY[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
      COMPREPLY=()
    fi

    return 0
}
complete -o default -F _openapi_yargs_completions openapi
###-end-openapi-completions-###
```

The command output contains installation instructions. For example, to install the completion script in `bash`, use:

```shell Command
redocly completion >> ~/.bashrc
```

The approach is similar for other shells. After the installation, restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.
