  organization:
    type: string
    description: |-
      Stores your Redocly Workflows organization ID that the `push` command uses to push API definition files to the API registry.
      If an organization ID is not passed explicitly in command-line arguments, `push` will look for it in `redocly.yaml`.

      This gives you the flexibility to reference specific files in commands, and configure each file at a granular level.
      We have a lot more information about [the `apis` section](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/configuration/#apis), plus lots of examples.

          You can force specific examples to appear in the response by adding the optional `x-redocly-response-body-example` header to your requests.
          If you pass an example ID that can't be found in the API definition, the mock server will return any other example.
          If `errorIfForcedExampleNotFound:true`, the mock server will return an error instead.

          By default, the mock server automatically enhances responses with heuristics, such as substituting response fields with request parameter values.
          If you set `strictExamples:true`, examples are returned in the response unmodified, and exactly how they are described in the OpenAPI definition.
