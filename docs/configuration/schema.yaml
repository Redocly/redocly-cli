      Stores your Redocly Workflows organization ID that the `push` command uses to push API definition files to the API registry.
      If an organization ID is not passed explicitly in command-line arguments, `push` will look for it in `redocly.yaml`.

      To find the organization ID:

        1. Log into Workflows.
        2. Access the **API registry** page.
        3. In your browser's address bar, find the page URL.
        4. The segment after `app.redocly.com/org/` is the organization ID.

      For example, if the URL is `app.redocly.com/org/test_docs`, the organization ID is `test_docs`.
