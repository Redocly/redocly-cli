# Redocly configuration file

The Redocly configuration file is used by Redocly CLI and other Redocly apps to control their behavior — from the strictness of the `lint` command, to how Redocly renders your docs.

- Workflows uses it in the API registry to manage your APIs and control advanced features like region and link resolution.
- Workflows and on-premise tools use it to apply your features and theme when building API docs.
- Redocly's VS Code extension uses it for linting criteria, to apply custom settings for live documentation previews, and to identify the path API definition root files.

## Filename, location, and format

The Redocly configuration file must be named either `redocly.yaml` or `.redocly.yaml`.
It must be located in the root of your project directory, and it must be in the YAML format.
If you cloned the `openapi-starter` project, this is already set up for you.

Redocly CLI will search for the configuration file in the working directory.

:::warning

If you have a `redocly.yaml` and a `.redocly.yaml` file  in the same directory, Redocly apps will show a warning in the output and ask you to choose one file.

## File structure

### Fixed properties
<StyledContent>
  <JsonSchema
    schema={Schema}
    options={{
      schemaExpansionLevel:0,
    }}
  />
</StyledContent>

### Example
```yaml
organization: testing_redocly
apis:
  core@v2:
    root: ./openapi/openapi.yaml
    styleguide:
      rules:
        no-ambiguous-paths: error
  external@v1:
    root: ./openapi/external.yaml
    labels:
      - external
    features.openapi:
      hideLogo: true

styleguide:
  extends:
    - recommended

features.openapi:
  schemaExpansionLevel: 2
  generateCodeSamples:
    languages:
      - lang: curl
      - lang: Python
```

### apis object

The `apis` object is used to configure one or more APIs.
Every API in the object is identified by its name and version in the format `name@version`.
The version is optional, and when not provided, Redocly apps interpret it as `latest` by default.
Every `name@version` combination listed in the object must be unique.

For every API listed in the object, you must provide the path to the OpenAPI definition using the `root` property.

#### Patterned properties

<StyledContent>
  <JsonSchema
    schema={ApiSchema}
    options={{
      schemaExpansionLevel:2,
    }}
  />
</StyledContent>

#### Example
```yaml
apis:
  name@version:
    root: ./openapi/openapi.yaml
    labels:
      - production
    styleguide: {}
    features.openapi: {}
```

:::warning Important

Not all `lint` options are supported in per-API configuration.
Consult the table below to understand how each configuration object applies to your APIs.

:::


Configuration object | Per-API support | Behavior
-- | -- | --
lint.extends | ❗ | API settings override global settings.
lint.rules | ✅ | API and global settings merge. In case of conflict, API takes priority.
lint.decorators | ✅ | API and global settings merge. In case of conflict, API takes priority.
lint.preprocessors | ✅ | API and global settings merge. In case of conflict, API takes priority.
lint.plugins | ❌ | Available in global configuration only.
features.openapi | ✅ | API and global settings merge. In case of conflict, API takes priority.
features.mockServer | ✅ | API and global settings merge. In case of conflict, API takes priority.


Some of the Redocly CLI commands, such as the [lint command](../commands/lint.md), use the API names from the `apis` object as shortcuts for referencing API definitions.
You can tell the `lint` command to validate specific API definitions by using their names from the `apis` object, like in the following example:

```shell
redocly lint core@v2
```

On the other hand, if you run the command without specifying any aliases, it will apply to all API definitions listed in the `apis` object:

```shell
redocly lint
```

### lint object

The `lint` object's primary purpose is to define options for the `lint` and `bundle` commands.
You may also import plugins and extends their configurations.

#### Fixed properties

<StyledContent>
  <JsonSchema
    schema={LintSchema}
    options={{
      schemaExpansionLevel:1,
    }}
  />
</StyledContent>

#### Example

```yaml
styleguide:
  extends:
    - recommended
  rules:
    no-ambiguous-paths: error
  decorators:
    remove-x-internal: on
```

### features.mockServer object

You can apply `features.mockServer` to individual APIs as well as at the global level.

Option | Per-API support | Behavior
-- | -- | --
features.mockServer | ✅ | API and global settings merge. In case of conflict, API takes priority.

The API registry supports [the mock server feature](../../api-registry/guides/mock-server-quickstart.md) and allows project owners to enable it for all branches per API version.
When the mock server is enabled for an API, you can send test requests to it from any API client.

The `features.mockServer` object allows additional configuration of the mock server behavior.
This object is optional.

#### Fixed properties
<StyledContent>
  <JsonSchema
    schema={MockServerSchema}
    options={{
      schemaExpansionLevel:1,
    }}
  />
</StyledContent>


### features.openapi object

The `features.openapi` object configures features and theming for API documentation generated from OpenAPI definitions.

If you need to apply different theming and functionality to individual APIs, add the `features.openapi` property to the `apis` section, and use the same options as the global `features.openapi`.

Find the full list of supported options on the [Reference docs configuration page](../../api-reference-docs/configuration/functionality.mdx).


### resolve object

Redocly will automatically resolve any API registry link or public URL in your API definitions.
If you want to resolve links that are neither API registry links nor publicly accessible, set the `resolve` object in your configuration file.

Redocly CLI supports one `http` header per URL.

#### Fixed properties
<StyledContent>
  <JsonSchema
    schema={ResolveSchema}
    options={{
      schemaExpansionLevel:2,
    }}
  />
</StyledContent>


#### Example

Here is an example for adding header definitions:

```yaml
resolve:
  http:
    headers:
      - matches: https://api.example.com/v2/**
        name: X-API-KEY
        envVariable: SECRET_KEY
      - matches: https://example.com/*/test.yaml
        name: Authorization
        envVariable: SECRET_AUTH
```
The first match takes priority when a URL matches multiple patterns.
Therefore, only the header from the first match will be used in the request.
