# Configuration file

## Purpose

The configuration file controls configuration options of the CLI tool.
It may be passed as metadata to the API registry which can then subsequently be used to build the docs.

## Filename and location

The CLI tool will search the current working directory for a configuration file named `.redocly.yaml`.

## File format

The configuration file is expected to be in YAML format.

The contents of the YAML are according to the following structure:

```yaml
apiDefinitions:
# A set of named keys and values of entrypoints to OpenAPI definitions.
# Example:
  petstore: ./openapi/openapi.yaml
  caretaker: ./openapi/caretaker.yaml

lint:
# The lint command options

region: eu
# Configuration for optional AWS region selection when logging into Redocly services.

resolve:
# Configuration for resolving external links in your definition that are not publicly accessible.
# Not required for Redocly API registry links.

referenceDocs:
# The API reference docs options, including theme options.

registry:
# The API registry options

# future products may be configured by extending this file
```

### apiDefinitions

The `apiDefinitions` section's purpose is to define one or more entrypoints to your OpenAPI 3 definitions.
Redocly supports both multi-file definitions and multiple (multi-file) definitions.

This section is optional.

The validation command uses the `apiDefinitions` for providing shortcuts to referencing the definition.

Based on the example `.redocly.yaml` file above, here is an example usage:
```shell
openapi-cli lint petstore caretaker
```

In addition, it allows for running the command which will apply to all APIs defined:
```shell
openapi-cli lint
```

### lint

The `lint` section's primary purpose is to define options for the `lint` and `bundle` commands.
You may also import plugins and extends their configurations.

Read more about the [lint configuration section](../guides/lint.md).


### region

For optimized performance or for compliance purposes, you can specify which region to use when logging into Redocly services (such as the API registry). Supported regions are `us` (used by default) and `eu`. 

You should log into the region that corresponds to your Redocly Workflows organization. If you're a member of multiple organizations in different regions, it's technically possible to log into two different regions at the same time, but it's neither the most common nor the recommended use-case. 

Every supported region uses its own domain.

Region | Domain      
-----|:---------
`us` | api.redoc.ly
`eu` | api.eu.redocly.com


To configure which domain will be used, you can use any of the following:

- the `REDOCLY_DOMAIN` environment variable

`export REDOCLY_DOMAIN={domain}`

- the `--region` option with `login` and `push` commands

`openapi login --region=eu`

- the `region` top-level property in the `.redocly.yaml` configuration file

```yaml
apiDefinitions:
  main: ./openapi.yaml
region: eu
lint:
  extends: []
```


### resolve

Redocly will automatically resolve any API registry link or public URL in your API definitions. However, you may want to resolve links that are not API registry links or publicly accessible. To accomplish that, add the `resolve` section to the configuration file.

OpenAPI CLI only supports `http` headers. Only one `http` header per URL is supported in the `resolve` section.

We recommend using environment variables whenever possible.

#### Resolving external links

The `resolve` section should be structured like this:

```yaml
resolve:
  http:
    headers:
      - # header configuration
```

The `headers` section supports fields listed in the following table.

| Property | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| matches | Glob match against the URL. | `https://api.example.com/**` or `https://api.example.com/*.json`|
| name | HTTP header name. | `Authorization` or `X-API-KEY`|
| value | The value of the header. Mutually exclusive with `envVariable`. | `123-abc`|
| envVariable | The name of the environment variable that contains the value of the header. Mutually exclusive with `value`. |`SECRET_KEY`|

Here is a structured example for adding header definitions:

```yaml
resolve:
  http:
    headers:
      - matches: https://api.example.com/v2/**
        name: X-API-KEY
        envVariable: SECRET_KEY
      - matches: https://example.com/*/test.yaml
        name: Authorization
        envVariable: SECRET_AUTH
```

The first match will win in the event that a URL matches multiple patterns. Therefore, only the header from the first match will be used in the request.

### referenceDocs

The `referenceDocs` section configures features (availability and options) and theming (style, fonts, colors).

There are two products: Redoc Community Edition (CE), and Redocly API reference docs. Reference docs supports all configuration options from Redoc Community Edition plus a set of premium options.

Find the full list of supported options on the [Reference docs configuration page](../../api-reference-docs/configuration/index.mdx).

### registry

The `registry` section is reserved for future API registry features.

Read more about the [`registry` section](registry.md).
