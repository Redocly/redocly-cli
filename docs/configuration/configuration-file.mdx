# Configuration file

## Purpose

The configuration file controls configuration options of the CLI tool.
It may be passed as metadata to the API registry which can then subsequently be used to build the docs.

## Filename and location

The CLI tool will search the current working directory for a configuration file named `.redocly.yaml`.

## File format

The configuration file is expected to be in YAML format.

The contents of the YAML are according to the following structure:

```yaml
apiDefinitions:
# A set of named keys and values of entrypoints to OpenAPI definitions.
# Example:
  petstore: ./openapi/openapi.yaml
  caretaker: ./openapi/caretaker.yaml

lint:
# The lint command options

features.mockServer:
# Configuration for the optional mock server feature in the API registry.
# Available in Pro and Enterprise plans only.

region: eu
# Configuration for optional AWS region selection when logging into Redocly services.

resolve:
# Configuration for resolving external links in your definition that are not publicly accessible.
# Not required for Redocly API registry links.

referenceDocs:
# The API reference docs options, including theme options.

registry:
# The API registry options

# future products may be configured by extending this file
```

### apiDefinitions

The `apiDefinitions` section's purpose is to set one or more entrypoints for your OpenAPI 3 definitions.
Redocly supports both multi-file definitions and multiple (multi-file) definitions.

This section is optional.

Define your entrypoints in the following format:

`definitionId: target`

The `definitionId` is an alias for the API definition. Use any custom name of your choice. We recommend names that are easy to remember and identify. The names are case-sensitive.

The `target` is the path to your OpenAPI definition.

The [validation command](../commands/lint.md) uses the aliases from the `apiDefinitions` section as shortcuts for referencing API definitions.
You can tell the `lint` command to validate specific API definitions by using their aliases from the `apiDefinitions` section, like in the following example:

```shell
openapi lint petstore caretaker
```

On the other hand, if you run the command without specifying any aliases, it will apply to all API definitions listed in the `apiDefinitions` section:

```shell
openapi lint
```

### lint

The `lint` section's primary purpose is to define options for the `lint` and `bundle` commands.
You may also import plugins and extends their configurations.

Read more about the [lint configuration section](../guides/lint.md).


### features.mockServer

The API registry supports [the mock server feature](../../api-registry/guides/mock-server-quickstart.md) and allows project owners to enable it for all branches per API version.
When the mock server is enabled for an API, you can send test requests to it from any API client.

The `features.mockServer` section allows additional configuration of the mock server behavior.
This section is optional.

The `features.mockServer` section supports fields listed in the following table.

| Property | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| errorIfForcedExampleNotFound | Users can force specific examples in the response by adding the optional `x-redocly-response-body-example` header to their requests. By default, if an example ID provided in the request is not found in the API definition, the mock server returns any other example. If you set `errorIfForcedExampleNotFound: true`, the mock server will return an error instead. | false |
| strictExamples | By default, the mock server automatically enhances responses with heuristics like substituting the response fields with request parameter values. To prevent this behavior, set `strictExamples: true`. When this is set, examples are returned in the response unmodified, exactly how they are defined in the OpenAPI document. | false |


### region

For optimized performance or for compliance purposes, you can specify which region to use when logging into Redocly services (such as the API registry). Supported regions are `us` (used by default) and `eu`.

You should log into the region that corresponds to your Redocly Workflows organization. If you're a member of multiple organizations in different regions, it's technically possible to log into two different regions at the same time, but it's neither the most common nor the recommended use-case.

Every supported region uses its own domain.

Region | Domain
-----|:---------
`us` | api.redoc.ly
`eu` | api.eu.redocly.com


To configure which domain will be used, you can use any of the following:

- the `REDOCLY_DOMAIN` environment variable

```sh
export REDOCLY_DOMAIN={domain}
```

- the `--region` option with `login` and `push` commands

```sh
openapi login --region=eu
```

- the `region` top-level property in the `.redocly.yaml` configuration file

```yaml
apiDefinitions:
  main: ./openapi.yaml
region: eu
lint:
  extends: []
```


### resolve

Redocly will automatically resolve any API registry link or public URL in your API definitions. However, you may want to resolve links that are not API registry links or publicly accessible. To accomplish that, add the `resolve` section to the configuration file.

OpenAPI CLI only supports `http` headers. Only one `http` header per URL is supported in the `resolve` section.

We recommend using environment variables whenever possible.

#### Resolving external links

The `resolve` section should be structured like this:

```yaml
resolve:
  http:
    headers:
      - # header configuration
```

The `headers` section supports fields listed in the following table.

| Property | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| matches | Glob match against the URL. | `https://api.example.com/**` or `https://api.example.com/*.json`|
| name | HTTP header name. | `Authorization` or `X-API-KEY`|
| value | The value of the header. Mutually exclusive with `envVariable`. | `123-abc`|
| envVariable | The name of the environment variable that contains the value of the header. Mutually exclusive with `value`. |`SECRET_KEY`|

Here is a structured example for adding header definitions:

```yaml
resolve:
  http:
    headers:
      - matches: https://api.example.com/v2/**
        name: X-API-KEY
        envVariable: SECRET_KEY
      - matches: https://example.com/*/test.yaml
        name: Authorization
        envVariable: SECRET_AUTH
```

The first match takes precedence when a URL matches multiple patterns. Therefore, only the header from the first match will be used in the request.


### referenceDocs

The `referenceDocs` section configures features (availability and options) and theming (style, fonts, colors).

There are two products: Redoc Community Edition (CE), and Redocly API reference docs. Reference docs supports all configuration options from Redoc Community Edition plus a set of premium options.

Find the full list of supported options on the [Reference docs configuration page](../../api-reference-docs/configuration/index.mdx).

### registry

The `registry` section is reserved for future API registry features.

Read more about the [`registry` section](registry.md).
