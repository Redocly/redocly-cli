# `preprocessors`

## Introduction

Preprocessors are similar to decorators, but they run before linting rather than after.

Refer to the [`decorator` configuration options](./decorators.md) documentation for details; the options available are the same in both the `decorators` and `preprocessor` sections of the configuration file.

## Related options
