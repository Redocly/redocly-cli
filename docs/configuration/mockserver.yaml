title: Mock server object
description: Lets you toggle features that control how mock servers behave.
properties:
  errorIfForcedExampleNotFound:
    description: >-
      You can force specific examples to appear in the response by adding the optional `x-redocly-response-body-example` header to your requests.
      If you pass an example ID that can't be found in the API definition, the mock server returns any other example unless `errorIfForcedExampleNotFound` is `true`.
      Then the mock server returns an error instead.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  strictExamples:
    description: >-
      By default, the mock server automatically enhances responses with heuristics, such as substituting response fields with request parameter values.
      If set as `true`, examples are returned in the response unmodified, and exactly how they are described in the OpenAPI definition.
    type: boolean
    default: false
