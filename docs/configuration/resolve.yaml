description: >-
  All API registry links and public URLs in your API definitions automatically resolve.
  If you want to resolve links that are neither API registry links nor publicly accessible, include this object to add an HTTP request header.

  If the URL matches multiple patterns, the first match takes priority.
  The header from the first match is used in the request.

  Use environment variables where possible.
