    Specifies the name and version of an API associated with the root API definition with the pattern `{name}@{version}`.
    If the version is omitted, Redocly apps interpret it as 'latest' by default.

    labels:
      type: array
      description: >-
        Use it to assign one or more existing Redocly Workflows organization-wide labels to your APIs.
        You must have a Redocly Workflows account with an active organization, and add the top-level `organization` property to the configuration file.

        If you try to assign labels that don't already exist for your organization, Redocly apps display a warning in the output and only assigns the existing labels (if any).
