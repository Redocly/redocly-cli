title: Lint object
description: Lets you set rules and decorators that control how the `lint` and `bundle` commands behave.
properties:
  doNotResolveExamples:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      You can stop `lint` from resolving `$refs` in examples by setting this configuration option to `true`.
      This does not affect `$ref` resolution in other parts of the API definition.
    default: false
  plugins:
    type: array
    description: >-
      Import any local filesystem plugins (e.g. `./local-plugins.js`).
      Note that community plugins are not yet supported.
    example: ['./local-plugin.js']
    items:
      type: string
      format: path
  extends:
    type: array
    description: >-
      Inherit lint configurations.
      In case of conflict, priority goes to configurations further down the list.
      Finally, explicit declaration of any rules inline takes precedence over configurations inherited through the `extends` feature.
      Built in configurations include `recommended`, `minimal`, `all`.
    items:
      type: string
      example: recommended
  preprocessors:
    type: object
    title: Preprocessors object
    description: >-
      Change the severity level of any preprocessors in your extended configurations.
      Preprocessors run first during `lint` and `bundle`.
    additionalProperties:
      description: >-
        List each preprocessor by name.
        For example, `do-this-first`.

            - on
            - off
        - type: object
          description: Specifies the severity level as an object. Useful when you need to supply additional properties for configuration.

              type: string
              enum:
                - on

              description: The severity level if the problem occurs.
          additionalProperties: true
  rules:
    type: object
    title: Rules object
    description: >-
      Change the severity level of any rules in your extended configurations.
      Some rules may also receive additional configurations.
      Rules run during the `lint` command after preprocessors.
      They run during the `bundle` command between preprocessors and decorators if the `--lint` option is used.
    additionalProperties:
      description: >-
        List each rule by name.
        For example, `no-empty-servers`.
        Redocly has over [40 built-in rules](../resources/built-in-rules/) you can configure.
        Some are highly configurable, including [assertions](../resources/rules/assertions/).
        For further customization, you can [create custom plugins with custom rules](../resources/custom-rules/).

      Used to enable or disable decorators.
      Decorators run during the `bundle` command after linting.
    additionalProperties:

        List each decorator by name.
        For example, `remove-x-internal`.
