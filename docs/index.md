# Redocly CLI

Redocly CLI is an open source command-line tool for working with OpenAPI descriptions, developer portals, and other API lifecycle operations.

* **Generate user-friendly API documentation** using open source [Redoc](https://github.com/redocly/redoc) or our hosted tooling.  Whether you're documenting an API or consuming someone else's, [clear and useful documentation](./api-docs.md) is a must-have. This tool makes it easy with local previews and static builds available.

* **OpenAPI descriptions made [manageable](./file-management.md)** with the ability to split an OpenAPI description into logical chunks, bundle the chunks to create a single file, or even join existing definitions into one.

* **Transform OpenAPI descriptions** by filtering out the correct endpoints for a specific use case. You can also use [decorators](./decorators.md) to enhance your existing OpenAPI and make a richer experience for users.

* **API governance, batteries included:** With our ready-made rulesets, check that your API meets a common standard every time it changes. Make use of the built-in and configurable rules to compose the API standards that fit each of your APIs. Extend Redocly to meet the [API governance you need](./api-standards.md) with custom plugins.

* **Seamless integration with Redocly** so you can work with all our tools from one handy API. Authenticate, update your API versions and portal contents, and work with all the other Redocly tools you know and love.
