# Redocly CLI

Redocly CLI is an open source command-line tool for working with OpenAPI descriptions, developer portals, and other API lifecycle operations.

* **Generate user-friendly API documentation** using open source Redoc or our hosted tooling.

  Whether you're documenting an API for customers, or making sense of someone else's OpenAPI descriptions, clear and useful documentation is a must-have. This tool makes it easy with local previews and static builds available.

* **OpenAPI descriptions made manageable** with the ability to split an OpenAPI description into logical chunks, bundle the chunks to create a single file, or even join existing definitions into one.

* **Transform OpenAPI descriptions** by filtering out the correct endpoints for a specific use case. You can also use our decorators feature to enhance your existing OpenAPI and make a richer experience for users.

* **API governance batteries included** with our ready-made rulesets, check that your API meets a common standard every time it changes. The tooling is designed to fit with the rest of your workflow, whether you're working locally or including this as part of your formal compliance workflow.

  Make use of the ready-made rules and assertions to compose the standards to apply to your use case - and use different configurations for each version of each API if you need to. If there's anything you need that isn't already built in, we also support creation of custom rules, so the sky is the limit.

* **Seamless integration with Redocly** so you can work with all our tools from one handy API. Authenticate, update your API versions and portal contents, and work with all the other Redocly tools you know and love.

## About Redocly and Redoc

Redoc is our open source API documentation tool. Use `redocly` (this project) to work with your Redoc documentation projects.

The Redocly CLI also supports many of the other operations you'll need to be successful working with OpenAPI. API linting, enhancement, bundling and other tools are also available as part of this open source CLI tool.

Redocly offers a full suite of API lifecycle tools as commercial offerings; you can manage those from this tool too.
