----

## 1.0.0-beta.65 (2021-10-27)

### Features

- Added three built-in decorators - `info-description-override`, `tag-description-override`, `operation-description-override` - that let you modify your API definitions during the bundling process. Use these decorators in the `lint` section of your `.redocly.yaml` file to point OpenAPI CLI to Markdown files with custom content. That custom content will replace any existing content in the `info.description` field, and in `tags.description` and `operation.description` fields for specified tag names and operation IDs.

The following examples show how to add the decorators to the `.redocly.yaml` file:


```yaml info-description-override
lint:
  decorators:
    info-description-override:
      filePath: ./my-custom-description.md
```

```yaml tag-description-override
lint:
  decorators:
    tag-description-override:
      tagNames:
        pet: ./my-custom-description.md
```

```yaml operation-description-override
lint:
  decorators:
    operation-description-override:
      operationIds:
        updatePet: ./my-custom-description.md
```

----


## 1.0.0-beta.19 (2020-11-13)

### Features

- The previously single OpenAPI CLI package has been split into two: `openapi-cli` and `openapi-core`.


----

- Resolved an issue with counting operation tags in the `stats` command.


----


## 1.0.0-beta-16 (2020-09-28)

### Features

- A new command called `stats` has been implemented. It provides statistics about the structure of one or more API definition files, and lets you choose the format in which the statistics will be presented.

----


## 1.0.0-beta-12 (2020-09-08)

### Fixes

- Previously, OpenAPI CLI tried to use `/` instead of `\` for file path splitting on Windows machines. The issue has been resolved by implementing platform-specific separator usage.
