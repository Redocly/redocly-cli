## 1.0.0-beta.96 (2022-05-06)

Technical release for changing the package name from `@redocly/openapi-cli` to `@redocly/cli`.

## 1.0.0-beta.95 (2022-05-04)

{% admonition type="warning" name="Product name change" %}
The product name has changed from OpenAPI CLI to **Redocly CLI**.

This change is reflected in all Redocly product documentation, in the npm package name (more on that in the "Deprecated" section),
and in the official project GitHub repository.

The change also affects the CLI commands. The legacy name `openapi` is supported for now, but we strongly recommend you use the new name `redocly`.
(To illustrate, if you previously used `openapi lint`, now you should use `redocly lint`).

If you encounter any issues and suspect they may be related to this change, let us know by [reporting an issue](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-cli/issues).

{% /admonition %}

### Features

- The `lint.extends` section in the Redocly configuration file supports file paths and URLs as values. This means you can define your own lint rulesets in local or remote files, and list those files in the `extends` section. The following example shows how to do it:

```yaml
extends:
  - recommended
  - ./path/to/local/lint-ruleset.yaml
  - https://url-to-remote/lint-ruleset.yaml
```

The contents of those referenced files must correspond to the standard format used in the `rules` object to configure the rules. Here is an example `lint-ruleset.yaml` file referenced above:

```yaml
rules:
  tags-alphabetical: error
```

- The `lint` command supports a new output formatting option called `codeclimate` that you can use with the `--format` argument.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue with resolvable scalar values not working in assertions.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated the `@redocly/openapi-cli` npm package. From this version forward, use `@redocly/cli` instead.

## 1.0.0-beta.94 (2022-04-12)

## 1.0.0-beta-91 (2022-03-29)

## 1.0.0-beta.65 (2021-10-27)

### Features

- Added three built-in decorators - `info-description-override`, `tag-description-override`, `operation-description-override` - that let you modify your API descriptions during the bundling process. Use these decorators in the `lint` section of your `redocly.yaml` file to point OpenAPI CLI to Markdown files with custom content. That custom content replaces any existing content in the `info.description` field, and in `tags.description` and `operation.description` fields for specified tag names and operation IDs.

The following examples show how to add the decorators to the `redocly.yaml` file:

```yaml info-description-override
lint:
  decorators:
    info-description-override:
      filePath: ./my-custom-description.md
```

```yaml tag-description-override
lint:
  decorators:
    tag-description-override:
      tagNames:
        pet: ./my-custom-description.md
```

lint:
  decorators:
    operation-description-override:

---

## 1.0.0-beta.22 (2020-11-16)

The resulting file optionally helps distinguish the origin of OpenAPI objects and properties by appending custom prefixes to them. Note that this command is considered experimental; meaning, it's still a work in progress.

---

## 1.0.0-beta.19 (2020-11-13)

- Resolved an issue with counting operation tags in the `stats` command.

---

## 1.0.0-beta-16 (2020-09-28)

---

## 1.0.0-beta-11 (2020-09-03)

### Fixes

- Resolved an issue with missing support for external plugins in the bundled version.

---
