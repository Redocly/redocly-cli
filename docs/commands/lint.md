# `lint`

## Introduction

Redocly CLI can identify and report on problems found in OpenAPI descriptions. This helps you avoid bugs and make API descriptions more consistent.

The `lint` command reports on problems and executes preprocessors and rules. Unlike the `bundle` command, `lint` doesn't execute decorators.

## Examples

### <a id="apis"></a>Lint APIs

The `lint` command behaves differently depending on how you pass apis to it and whether the [configuration file](#custom-configuration-file) exists.

#### Pass an API directly

`redocly lint openapi/openapi.yaml`

In this case, `lint` validates the API description(s) passed to the command. If you have no configuration file defined, the [recommended ruleset](../rules/recommended.md) is used. If you have `extends` or `rules` defined in `redocly.yaml`, those are used when linting.

The `apis` argument can also use any glob format supported by your file system. For example, `redocly lint ./root-documents/*.yaml`.

#### An API from the configuration file

Instead of full paths, you can use names listed in the `apis` section of your Redocly configuration file. The example `redocly.yaml` file below shows an API alias `core@v1` defined:

```yaml
apis:
  core@v1:
    root: ./openapi/api-description.json
```

Use the alias with the lint command as shown:

`redocly lint core@v1`

In this case, after resolving the path behind the `core@v1` name (see the `Configuration file` tab), `lint` validates the `api-description.json` file. The presence of the Redocly configuration file is mandatory.

#### All configured APIs

You can omit apis completely when executing the `lint` command to check all APIs defined in the configuration file. Run `redocly lint` with no arguments to lint all defined APIs; an example `redocly.yaml` file is shown below:

```yaml
apis:
  core@v1:
    root: ./openapi/api-description.json
  production:
    root: ./openapi/production.yaml
  sandbox:
    root: ./openapi/sandbox.yaml
```

{% admonition type="warning" name="Important" %}
If you try to execute the `lint` command without apis when your project doesn't have any configuration files, the `lint` command displays an error.
{% /admonition %}

### Custom configuration file

By default, the CLI tool looks for the [Redocly configuration file](../configuration/index.md) in the current working directory. Use the optional `--config` argument to provide an alternative path to a configuration file.

`redocly lint --config=./another/directory/config.yaml`

### Extend configuration

The `--extends` option allows you to extend the existing configuration. This option accepts one of the following values: `minimal`, `recommended`, `recommended-strict` or `all`. Each of the values is a base set of rules that the lint command uses. You can further modify this set in cases when you want to have your own set of rules based on the existing one, including particular rules that cover your specific needs.

{% admonition type="warning" name="Important" %}
When you run the `lint` command without a configuration file, it uses the `extends: [recommended]` by default.
However, if you have a configuration file, but it doesn't include any rules or extends configuration, the `lint` command shows an error.
{% /admonition %}

### Format lint output

The standard codeframe output format works well in most situations, but `redocly` can also produce output to integrate with other tools.

{% admonition type="warning" name="Lint one API at a time" %}
Some formats, such as CheckStyle or JSON, don't work well when mulitple APIs are linted in a single command. Try linting each API separately when you pass the command output to another tool.
{% /admonition %}

#### Codeframe (default)

The command `redocly lint --format=codeframe` lints the file and uses the default format of `codeframe`. It produces the same output as below if you omit the `--format` parameter.

```bash
[1] museum-with-errors.yaml:19:7 at #/paths/~1museum-hours/get/operationIds

Property `operationIds` is not expected here.

Did you mean: operationId ?

17 | summary: Get museum hours
18 | description: Get upcoming museum operating hours
19 | operationIds: getMuseumHours
20 | tags:
21 |   -  Operations

Error was generated by the spec rule.
```

Note that the problems are displayed in the following format: `file:line:column`. For example, `museum-with-errors.yaml:19:7`.

Depending on the terminal emulator you use, it may be possible to directly click this indicator to edit the file in place.

#### Stylish

The command `redocly lint --format=stylish` gives a more condensed output that is useful for summarizing the linting results, as seen below:

```bash
museum-with-errors.yaml:
  19:7   error    spec                   Property `operationIds` is not expected here.
  29:11  error    spec                   Property `require` is not expected here.
  16:5   warning  operation-operationId  Operation object should contain `operationId` field.
```

In this format, `lint` shows the file name, line number, and column where the problem occurred. However, the output is compressed and omits other contexts and suggestions.

##### JSON

It can be useful to get the output in JSON format to be processed by other tools. Use a command like `redocly lint --format=json` to get the following output:

```bash
{
  "totals": {
    "errors": 2,
    "warnings": 1,
    "ignored": 0
  },
  "version": "1.7.0",
  "problems": [
    {
      "ruleId": "spec",
      "severity": "error",
      "message": "Property `operationIds` is not expected here.",
      "suggest": [
        "operationId"
      ],
      "location": [
        {
          "source": {
            "ref": "museum-with-errors.yaml"
          },
          "pointer": "#/paths/~1museum-hours/get/operationIds",
          "reportOnKey": true
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "ruleId": "spec",
      "severity": "error",
      "message": "Property `require` is not expected here.",
      "suggest": [],
      "location": [
        {
          "source": {
            "ref": "museum-with-errors.yaml"
          },
          "pointer": "#/paths/~1museum-hours/get/responses/200/require",
          "reportOnKey": true
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "ruleId": "operation-operationId",
      "severity": "warn",
      "message": "Operation object should contain `operationId` field.",
      "location": [
        {
          "source": {
            "ref": "museum-with-errors.yaml"
          },
          "pointer": "#/paths/~1museum-hours/get/operationId",
          "reportOnKey": true
        }
      ],
      "suggest": []
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Checkstyle

The `lint` command also supports the [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org/) XML report format
Use a command like `redocly lint --format=checkstyle` to get this standard format output to use with your other tools.

```bash
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<checkstyle version="4.3">
<file name="museum-with-errors.yaml">
<error line="19" column="7" severity="error" message="Property `operationIds` is not expected here." source="spec" />
<error line="29" column="11" severity="error" message="Property `require` is not expected here." source="spec" />
<error line="16" column="5" severity="warning" message="Operation object should contain `operationId` field." source="operation-operationId" />
</file>
</checkstyle>
```

Due to the limitations of this format, only file name, line, column, severity,
and rule ID (in the `source` attribute) are included. All other information is
omitted.

#### GitHub Actions

The `lint` command also comes with support for a [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) specific formatting.
Use `redocly lint --format=github-actions` to have any encountered problem annotated on the affected files.

```bash
::error title=spec,file=museum-with-errors.yaml,line=19,endLine=19,col=7,endColumn=7::Property `operationIds` is not expected here.
::error title=spec,file=museum-with-errors.yaml,line=29,endLine=29,col=11,endColumn=11::Property `require` is not expected here.
::warning title=operation-operationId,file=museum-with-errors.yaml,line=16,endLine=16,col=5,endColumn=5::Operation object should contain `operationId` field.
```

### <a id="max-problems"></a>Limit the problem count

With the `--max-problems` option, you can limit the number of problems displayed in the command output. If the number of detected problems exceeds the specified threshold, the remaining problems are hidden under the "spoiler message" that lets you know how many problems were hidden.

```bash
< ... 2 more problems hidden > increase with `--max-problems N`
```

The default value is 100.

### Generate ignore file

With this option, you can generate the `.redocly.lint-ignore.yaml` file to suppress error and warning severity problems in the output. You still receive visual feedback to let you know how many problems were ignored.

This option is useful when you have an API design standard, but have some exceptions to the rule (for example, a legacy API operation). It allows for highly granular control.

`redocly lint museum-with-errors.yaml --generate-ignore-file` runs the lint command and adds all the errors to an ignore file.

```bash
Generated ignore file with 3 problems.
```

The errors in the ignore file `.redocly.lint-ignore.yaml` are ignored when the `lint` command is run.

{% admonition type="warning" %}
This command overwrites an existing ignore file.
{% /admonition %}

To generate an ignore file for multiple API descriptions, pass them as arguments:

`redocly lint v1.yaml v2.yaml --generate-ignore-file`

Example of an ignore file:

```yaml .redocly.lint-ignore.yaml file
# This file instructs Redocly's linter to ignore the rules contained for specific parts of your API.
# See https://redoc.ly/docs/cli/ for more information.
museum-with-errors.yaml:
  spec:
    - '#/paths/~1museum-hours/get/operationIds'
    - '#/paths/~1museum-hours/get/responses/200/require'
  operation-operationId:
    - '#/paths/~1museum-hours/get/operationId'
```

The rule in the example is named `spec`, which indicates compliance with the OpenAPI spec. You can also manually add problems that should be ignored to specific rules.

### Skip preprocessor or rule

You may want to skip specific preprocessors or rules upon running the command. Examples for each option are as follows:

- `redocly lint --skip-preprocessor=discriminator-mapping-to-one-of --skip-preprocessor=another-example`

- `redocly lint --skip-rule=no-sibling-refs --skip-rule=no-parent-tags`

{% admonition type="success" name="Tip" %}
To learn more about preprocessors, rules, and decorators, refer to the [custom plugins](../custom-plugins/index.md) page.
{% /admonition %}

### Lint config file

The `lint` command also validates the configuration file. You may want to set severity level by using the `--lint-config` option. This option accepts one of the following values: `warn`,`error`,`off`. Default value is `warn`.
