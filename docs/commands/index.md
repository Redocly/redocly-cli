# Redocly OpenAPI CLI commands

Redocly OpenAPI CLI currently supports the following commands:

* [bundle](bundle.md)
* [join](join.md)
* [lint](lint.md) 
* [login](login.md)
* [logout](logout.md)
* [preview-docs](preview-docs.md)
* [push](push.md)
* [split](split.md)
* [stats](stats.md)

To define the behavior of the commands, you can use configuration files:

- `.redocly.yaml` - define the location of your root files, linting rules, and reference docs configuration information.
- `.redocly.lint-ignore.yaml` - ignore specific lint messages.

For more information, refer to the [configuration section](../configuration/index.mdx).

:::attention Note

The CLI tool looks for configuration files in the current working directory. If it detects them, it will use the options set in those configuration files for the commands. Learn more about the [configuration file structure and options](../configuration/configuration-file.mdx).

When executing any of the commands, you can override the default configuration file by providing a path to another configuration file with the `--config` option.
