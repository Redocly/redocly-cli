# `push`

## Introduction

:::attention

Redocly Workflows integrates with [popular version control services](../../workflows/sources/index.md) and uses them as the source of your API definitions to help you automatically validate, build, and deploy API reference docs and developer portals. This approach requires you to give Redocly Workflows access to your repositories.

:::

In case when you don't want or are not able to grant Redocly Workflows permissions to your repositories or when your API definitions are generated automatically from code annotations in a CI/CD pipeline, you can use the OpenAPI CLI `push` command and set up your own CI pipeline to update API definitions without granting Redocly Workflows access to your repositories. This allows you to:

- Benefit from using Redocly Workflows to preview documentation and portal builds.
- Manage versions in the API registry.

Apart from uploading your API definition file, the `push` command can automatically upload other files if they are detected or referenced in the API definition:

- the `.redocly.yaml` configuration file
- the `package.json` file (if it exists) from the folder where you're executing the `push` command. Redocly Workflows will use the `@redocly/openapi-cli` version specified in `package.json`.
- the HTML template and the full contents of the folder specified as the `referenceDocs > htmlTemplate` parameter in `.redocly.yaml`.

:::attention

If a plugin is referenced in the `.redocly.yaml` file, the `push` command will recursively scan the folder containing the plugin and upload all `.js`, `.json`, `.mjs` and `.ts` files.

Make sure that each plugin has all the required files in its folder, otherwise they will not be uploaded.

:::

By default, the `push` command only updates an existing API definition version. If an API with the provided name and version doesn't exist in your organization, it will not be created automatically. Proceed to the [Upsert an API with push](#upsert-an-api-with-push) section for more details on how to create an API.

:::warning

Note that only API definitions with a CI source can be updated with the `push` command. Attempting to update API definitions created from other sources will fail with an error.

:::

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the `push` command, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Active user account in a Redocly Workflows organization.
1. Active [personal API key or organization API key](../../settings/personal-api-keys.md).

## Authentication

To authenticate to the API registry, you can use several approaches:

- use the [`login` command](login.md). In this case, the command will look as follows:

  ```bash
  openapi login
  opanapi push ...
  ```

  Refer to the [`login` command documentation](login.md) for more details.

- set the `REDOCLY_AUTHORIZATION` environment variable to either your [personal API key](../../settings/personal-api-keys.md) or to an organization-wide API key (configurable by organization owners in **Redocly Workflows > Settings > API keys**). In this case, the command may look as follows:

  ```bash
  REDOCLY_AUTHORIZATION=yourPersonalApiKey openapi push ...
  ```

  Treat the API keys as secrets and work with them accordingly. Consult the documentation for your CI system to learn more about handling secrets:

  - [Travis CI documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/)
  - [CircleCI documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/)
  - [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets)
  - [Jenkins documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#handling-credentials)

## Examples

### Entrypoint

The command behaves differently depending on how you pass an entrypoint to it and whether the configuration file exists.

#### Pass entrypoint directly

```bash
openapi push openapi/petstore.yaml @openapi-org/petstore-api@v1
```

In this case, `push` will upload only the definition that was passed to the command. The configuration file is ignored.

#### Pass entrypoint via configuration file

Instead of a full path, you can use an alias assigned in the `apiDefinitions` section within your `.redocly.yaml` configuration file as the entrypoint. For example, `petstore`:

```bash request
openapi push petstore @openapi-org/petstore-api@v1
```

```yaml .redocly.yaml
apiDefinitions:
  petstore: ./openapi/petstore.yaml
```

In this case, after resolving the path behind the `petstore` alias (example in the `.redocly.yaml` tab), `push` will upload both the `petstore.yaml` definition file and the `.redocly.yaml` configuration file to the Redocly API registry. For this approach, the `redocly.yaml` configuration file is mandatory.

### Destination

To properly push your API definition to the Redocly API registry, you need the following information:

- [Organization ID](#organization-id)
- [API name](#api-name)
- [API version](#api-version)

The format to pass this information is the following: `@organization-id/api-name@api-version`.

#### Organization ID

To find your organization ID required for the command:

1. Log into Workflows.
1. Access the **API registry** page.
1. In your browser's address bar, find the URL of this page.
1. Inspect the segment after `app.redoc.ly/org/`. This part is your organization ID.

For example, if the URL is `app.redoc.ly/org/test_docs`, the organization ID is `test_docs`. When using the `push` command, you would provide this ID as `@test_docs`.

:::warning Note

The organization ID can differ from the organization name. Owners can change the organization name at any time in the Workflows **Settings** page, but the organization ID cannot be changed.

:::

#### API name

To find your API name required for the command:

1. Log into Workflows.
1. Access the **API registry** page.
1. Check the list of APIs displayed on this page.
1. Inspect the title of each list item to the left of the **New version** and **Edit API** action buttons. This title is an API name.

When using the `push` command, you would provide the API name after the [Organization ID](#organization-id) separated with the forward slash (`/`). For example: `@test_docs/petstore-api`.

:::attention

The name of your API should contain only supported characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, `.`). Using a restricted character will result in an error, and your API will not be created.

:::

#### API version

To find your API version required for the command:

1. Log into Workflows.
1. Access the **API registry** page.
1. Check the list of APIs displayed on this page.
1. Inspect the subtitle of each list item to the bottom of the [API name](#api-name). This subtitle is an API version.

When using the `push` command, you would provide the API version after the [API name](#api-name) separated with the "at" symbol (`@`). For example: `@test_docs/petstore-api@v1`.

:::attention

The version of your API should contain only supported characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, `.`). Using a restricted character will result in an error, and your API will not be created.

:::

### Run ID

The `--run-id` option can be used by Redocly Workflows to associate multiple pushes with a single CI job. It is auto-populated for the following CI systems so you don't have to pass it separately:

- Travis CI
- CircleCI
- GitHub Actions

Below are possible use cases for the `--run-id` option:

- CI/CD systems: group pushes from a single CI job together so that each push does not trigger separate reference docs/portals rebuild.
- External systems: a parameter that can be used in reports, metrics, analytics to refer to a specific application service state.

### Upsert an API with push

To upsert an API/version with the `push` command, use the `--upsert` or `-u` option:

```bash
openapi push -u test-api-v1.yaml @redocly/test-api@v1 main
```

### Set up CI from Redocly Workflows

The Redocly Workflows interface can help you get started with the `push` command.

1. In **API registry**, select **Add API**.
1. In the **Definition name** step, provide a name for your new API definition.
1. In the **Choose source** step, select **Upload from CI/CD**. This will generate syntax for the `push` command that you can copy and use to upload a new API definition file. Alternatively, use the `openapi push -u` command directly from the command-line interface.
