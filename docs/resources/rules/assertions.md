# `assertions`

Configure assertions to enforce your API design standards without coding custom rules.

Define `assertions` in the rules map of the `lint` section in the Redocly configuration file.

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions: ...
```

An assertion describes the contents that the linter expects to find in your API definition. During the validation process, the linter goes through your API definition and checks if its contents match the expectations. If something was described in an assertion, but the API definition doesn't correspond to the description, the linter shows you a warning or error message in the log.


Property | Type | Description
-- | -- | --
assertions | [[Assertion object]](#assertion-object) | A list of assertions to enforce your custom API design standards. Add or edit your assertions in the configuration file. The `assertions` rule is composed of a list of `assertion` objects. This rule may result in more than one problem message, as you may define more than one assertion. More than one assertion may be defined in the list, and any assertion may have multiple asserts.

## Assertion object

Property | Type | Description
-- | -- | --
subject | `string` \| [`string`] | **REQUIRED.** The [OpenAPI node type](#openapi-node-types) that the lint evaluates. Use with `context` for more control.
property | `string` \| [`string`] \| null | Property name corresponding to the [OpenAPI node type](#openapi-node-types). If a list of properties is provided, assertions will evaluate against each property in the sequence. If not provided (or null), assertions will evaluate against the key names for the subject node type. See [property example](#property-example).
context | [Context object](#context-object) | The context influences evaluation for assertions. When `matchParentKeys` or `excludeParentKeys` is used in the `context` object, it evaluates the specified subset of the subject type. The resolution of reference objects is done at the context level. If no context is provided, it evaluates the assertion for all instances of the given type. See [context example](#context-example). 
message | `string` | Optional problem message displayed if the assertion is false. If omitted, the default message "The assertion doesn't meet required conditions" will be displayed.
suggest | [`string`] | Optional list of suggestions to display if the problem occurs.
severity | `string` | Optional field to configure the severity level of the problem if the assertion is false. It must be one of these values: `error`, `warn`, `off`. Default value is `error`.
assertionId | `string` | ID displayed in the lint log if the assertion fails. Useful for troubleshooting and identifying the assertion.
enum | [`string`] | Asserts a value is within a predefined list of values. See [enum example](#enum-example).
pattern | `string` | Asserts a value matches a regex pattern. See [regex pattern example](#pattern-example).
casing | `string` | Asserts a casing style. Supported styles are: `camelCase`, `kebab-case`, `snake_case`, `PascalCase`, `MACRO_CASE`, `COBOL-CASE`, `flatcase`. See [casing example](#casing-example).
mutuallyExclusive | [`string`] | Asserts that listed properties (key names only) are mutually exclusive. See [mutuallyExclusive example](#mutuallyexclusive-example).
mutuallyRequired | [`string`] | Asserts that listed properties (key names only) are mutually required. See [mutuallyRequired example](#mutuallyrequired-example).
required | [`string`] | Asserts all listed values are defined. See [required example](#required-example).
disallowed | [`string`] | Asserts all listed values are not defined. See [disallowed example](#disallowed-example).
defined | `boolean` | Asserts a property is defined. See [defined example](#defined-example).
undefined | `boolean` | Asserts a property is undefined. See [undefined example](#undefined-example).
nonEmpty | `boolean` | Asserts a property is not empty. See [nonEmpty example](#nonempty-example).
minLength | `integer` | Asserts a minimum length (inclusive) of a string or list (array). See [minLength example](#minlength-example).
maxLength | `integer` | Asserts a maximum length (exclusive) of a string or list (array). See [maxLength example](#maxlength-example).

## Context object

Property | Type | Description
-- | -- | --
type | `string` | **REQUIRED.** One of the [OpenAPI node types](#openapi-node-types).
matchParentKeys | [`string`] | The list of parent object key names to evaluate with respect to the subject.
excludeParentKeys | [`string`] | The list of parent object key names to not evaluate with respect to the subject.

See the [context example](#context-example).

## Examples

The following example shows four assertions with multiple asserts in each one (`defined`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`).

The `Operation`, `Tag`, and `Info` properties must:
- be defined
- have at least 30 characters
- end with a _full stop_.

In addition, the `Operation` summary property must:
- be defined
- be between 20 and 60 characters
- not end with a _full stop_.

The following example shows how to configure those assertions:

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: Tag
        property: description
        message: Tag description must be at least 30 characters and end with a full stop.
        severity: error
        defined: true
        minLength: 30
        pattern: /\.$/
      - subject: Operation
        property: description
        message: Operation description must be at least 30 characters and end with a full stop.
        severity: error
        defined: true
        minLength: 30
        pattern: /\.$/
      - subject: Info
        property: description
        message: Info description must be at least 30 characters and end with a full stop.
        severity: error
        defined: true
        minLength: 30
        pattern: /\.$/
      - subject: Operation
        property: summary
        message: Operation summary must be between 20 and 60 characters and not end with a full stop.
        severity: error
        defined: true
        minLength: 20
        maxLength: 60
        pattern: /[^\.]$/
```

### `property` example

The following example asserts that every path item has a GET operation defined.

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: PathItem
        property: get
        message: Every path item must have a GET operation.
        defined: true
```

A different way to declare the same assertion is to require that the `PathItem` has the `get` key.
Notice we don't need to include `property` in this approach.

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: PathItem
        message: Every path item must have a GET operation.
        required: 
          - get
```

The following example asserts that Tags have both name and description defined.

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: Tag
        property:
          - name
          - description
        message: Every tag must have a name and description.
        defined: true
```

Another way to compose that rule is to require the subject keys:

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: Tag
        message: Every tag must have a name and description.
        required:
          - name
          - description
```

### `context` example

The following example asserts that PUT responses with HTTP status 200 or 201 cannot return an `application/pdf`content type.
Without the `context`, the assertion would evaluate every MediaTypeMap including:
- Responses with all codes, including codes other than 200 or 201
- Responses for all HTTP methods, including DELETE, GET, POST, and more.
To restrict the evaluation, use the `context` feature to limit what will be evaluated.

```yaml
assertions:
  - context:
    - type: Operation
      matchParentKeys: [put]
    - type: Response
      matchParentKeys: ['201', '200']
    subject: MediaTypeMap
    disallowed: ['application/pdf']
```

### `enum` example

The following example asserts that only `application/json` can be used as a key of the MediaTypeMap.

```yaml keys
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: MediaTypeMap
        message: Only application/json can be used
        severity: error
        enum:
          - application/json
```

The following example asserts that the operation summary must match one of the listed enums.

```yaml values
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: Operation
        property: summary
        message: Summary must be one of the predefined values
        suggest:
          - change to 'My resource'
          - change to 'My collection'
        severity: error
        enum:
          - My resource
          - My collection
```

### `pattern` example

The following example asserts that the operation summary contains "test".

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: Operation
        property: summary
        message: Summary should match a regex
        severity: error
        pattern: /test/
```

### `casing` example

The following example asserts the casing style is `PascalCase` for NamedExamples map keys.

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: NamedExamples
        message: NamedExamples key must be in PascalCase
        severity: error
        casing: PascalCase
```

Casing supports the following styles: 
- camelCase
- COBOL-CASE
- flatcase
- kebab-case
- snake_case
- PascalCase
- MACRO_CASE


### `mutuallyExclusive` example

The following example asserts the operation `description` and `externalDocs` must be mutually exclusive.
This assertion evaluates only property keys for the node, but not property values.

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: Operation
        message: "Operation must not define both properties together: description and externalDocs"
        severity: error
        mutuallyExclusive:
          - description
          - externalDocs
```

### `mutuallyRequired` example

The following example asserts that a response body schema must have both `amount` and `currency` properties (and not either one by itself).
This assertion evaluates only property keys for the node, but not property values.

```yaml Schema example
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: SchemaProperties
        message: The created_at and updated_at properties are mutually required
        severity: error
        mutuallyRequired:
          - created_at
          - updated_at
```

The following example asserts that when `PUT` requests have either `200` or `201` defined, both `200` and `201` responses must be defined.

```yaml Response example
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: ResponsesMap
        context:
          - type: Operation
            matchParentKeys:
              - put
        message: Must mutually define 200 and 201 responses for PUT requests.
        severity: error
        mutuallyRequired:
          - '200'
          - '201'
```

### `required` example

The following example asserts that `PUT` requests have both `200` and `201` responses defined.
The difference between `mutuallyRequired` is that neither `200` and `201` need to be defined for it to meet `mutuallyRequired` evaluations.

```yaml Response example
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: ResponseMap
        context:
          - type: Operation
            matchParentKeys:
              - put
        message: Must define 200 and 201 responses for PUT requests.
        severity: error
        required:
          - '200'
          - '201'
```

### `disallowed` example

The following example asserts that `x-code-samples` and `x-internal` are not defined.

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: Operation
        message: x-code-samples and x-internal must not be defined
        severity: error
        disallowed:
          - x-code-samples
          - x-internal
```

### `defined` example

The following example asserts that `x-codeSamples` is defined.

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: Operation
        property: x-codeSamples
        message: x-codeSamples must be defined
        severity: error
        defined: true
```

### `undefined` example

The following example asserts that `x-code-samples` is undefined.

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: Operation
        property: x-code-samples
        message: x-code-samples is deprecated
        suggest: 
          - x-codeSamples instead of x-code-samples
        severity: error
        undefined: true
```

### `nonEmpty` example

The following example asserts that the operation summary is not empty.

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: Operation
        property: summary
        message: Operation summary should not be empty
        severity: error
        nonEmpty: true
```

### `minLength` example

The following example asserts that the minimum length of each operation summary is 20 characters.

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: Operation
        property: summary
        message: Operation summary must have minimum of 20 chars length
        severity: error
        minLength: 20
```

### `maxLength` example

The following example asserts that the maximum length of each operation summary is 20 characters.

```yaml
lint:
  rules:
    assertions:
      - subject: Operation
        property: summary
        message: Operation summary must have a maximum of 20 characters
        severity: error
        maxLength: 20
```
