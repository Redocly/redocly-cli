## Issue reporting guidelines

- Before opening a new issue, try to make sure the same problem or idea hasn't already been reported. You can do that on the [Issues page](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-cli/issues) in the repository and using the filter `is:issue` combined with some keywords relevant to your idea or problem. It helps us notice that more people have the same issue or use-case, and reduces the chance of getting your issue marked as a duplicate. Plus, you can even find some workarounds for your issue in the comments of a previously reported one!

- The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a (reduced) test case. This means listing and explaining the steps we should take to try and hit the same problem you're having. It helps us understand in which conditions the issue appears, and gives us a better idea of what may be causing it.

- Abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://redocly.com/code-of-conduct/) in all your interactions on this repository, and show patience and respect to other community members.

## Pull request guidelines

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
1. Run `npm install` in the repository root.
1. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, don't forget to add [tests](#tests)!
1. Ensure the test suite passes (see the [Tests section](#tests) for more details).
1. Format your code with prettier (`npm run prettier`).
1. Each feat/fix PR should also contain a changeset (to create one, run `npx changeset`; if your changes are scoped to `packages/core` or `packages/respect-core` but also affect Redocly CLI behavior, please include the `@redocly/cli` package as well). Please describe what you've done in this PR using sentence case (you can refer to our [changelog](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/changelog/)). This produces a file in `.changeset` folder. Please commit this file along with your changes. If the PR doesn't need a changeset (for example, it is a small change, or updates only documentation), add the 'no changeset needed' label to the PR.
1. When merging a PR, make sure to remove all redundant commit information (like intermediate commit descriptions). Please leave only the main commit description (plus co-authors if needed). If you think it makes sense to keep several commit descriptions, please rebase your PR instead of squashing it to preserve the commits. Please use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

## Development setup

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) at v22.12.0+ and NPM v10.9.2+ are required.

After forking the repo, run:

```bash
npm install # or npm i
```

### Commonly used NPM scripts

To compile the code, run `npm run compile`.

To run a specific CLI command, use `npm run cli`, e.g. `npm run cli -- lint resources/museum.yaml --format=stylish`.
Please notice that the extra `--` is required to pass arguments to the CLI rather than to NPM itself.

Format your code with `npm run prettier` before committing.

Please check the [Tests section](#tests) for the test commands reference.

There are some other scripts available in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file.

## Development guidelines

### Logging

When contributing to Redocly CLI, it's important to follow these logging guidelines:

1. Use the built-in logger from `@redocly/openapi-core` package:

   ```typescript
   import { logger } from '@redocly/openapi-core';
   ```

2. All informational messages, warnings, and errors should be written to `stderr` using the appropriate logger methods:

   - `logger.info()` for general information
   - `logger.warn()` for warnings
   - `logger.error()` for errors

3. Only write to `stdout` when the output is meant to be consumed by other applications or tools (like when piping to `jq` or other CLI tools). This includes:

   - Command output that needs to be parsed
   - Interactive outputs (like login/logout responses)
   - Data that needs to be piped to other commands

   ```typescript
   logger.output(JSON.stringify(stats, null, 2));
   ```

4. Avoid using `console.log`, `console.error`, or direct `process.stdout.write`/`process.stderr.write` calls. Always use the logger methods to ensure consistent output formatting and proper stream usage.

## Local source code usage

There are two options for testing local changes in other local applications: NPM linking and local packing and installing from the `redocly-cli.tgz` file.

### NPM linking

To test the local source code of the packages in other local applications, you can use npm linking. See the [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-link).

### Local packing and installing

To test local changes as a package, you can use the following steps:

1. Optionally, bump the version of the packages ([see details](#version-updating)).

1. Run `npm run pack:prepare` in the repository's root.
   This generates **redocly-cli.tgz**, **respect-core.tgz**, and **openapi-core.tgz** files.

1. Copy those **.tgz** files to a destination folder and then run `npm install redocly-cli.tgz` there to install Redocly CLI. To install `openapi-core` do the same but with **openapi-core.tgz** file.

## Contribute documentation

Additions and updates to our documentation are very welcome.
You can find the documentation in the `docs/` folder, and this is published to https://redocly.com/docs/cli/ as part of our main website.

To preview your documentation changes locally:

1. Make sure `redocly` is already installed on your local computer. See [installation](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/installation/).

2. Run this command from the `docs/` folder:

```bash
redocly preview
```

By default, you can access the docs preview at http://localhost:4000 or http://127.0.0.1:4000.

> Please note that currently the custom markdoc tags used in the main website are not available in the local preview version, and links that point to the wider website do show as errors when using a local platform.
> The pull request workflows generate a full preview, so rest assured that you are able to check everything is in good shape before we review and merge your changes.

### Prose linting

We are proud of our docs.
When you open a pull request, we lint the prose using [Vale](https://vale.sh/).
You can also install this tool locally and run it from the root of the project with:

```bash
vale docs/
```

The configuration is in `.vale.ini` in the root of the project.

### Markdown linting

We use [Markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) to check that the Markdown in our docs is well formatted. The checks run as part of the pull request, and you can also run this tool locally. Follow the instructions from the markdownlint project page, and then run `markdownlint docs/` in the top-level folder of this repository.

> Note that prettier also runs and reformats Markdown files. Use `npm run prettier` from the root of the project.

### Markdown link checking

We use [`mlc`](https://github.com/becheran/mlc) to check the links in the `docs/` folder.
This tool runs automatically on every pull request, but you can also run it locally if you want to.
Visit the project homepage to find the installation instructions for your platform, and then run the command like this:

```bash
mlc docs/
```

It only checks links within the local docs (it can't check links to other docs sections that are present when we publish all products under https://redocly.com/docs), and doesn't currently check anchors, so take care when renaming pages or titles.

## Built-in rules changes

After adding a new rule, make sure it is added to the `minimal`, `recommended`, `recommended-strict` (the same as the previous but with warnings turned into error) and `all` rulesets with appropriate severity levels.
The defaults are `off` for `minimal` and `recommended` and `error` for `all`.
Also add the rule to the built-in rules list in [the config types tree](./packages/core/src/types/redocly-yaml.ts).

Separately, open a merge request with the corresponding documentation changes.

## Arguments usage

There are three ways of providing arguments to the CLI: environment variables, command line arguments, and Redocly configuration file.

### Environment variables

Environment variables should be used to provide some arguments that are common for all the commands.
We always prefer configuration over environment variables.
Environment variables should not affect the **core** package logic.

### Command line arguments

Use them to provide some arguments that are specific to a certain command.
Think of them as modifiers.
They should not affect the **core** package logic.

### Configuration file

The **redocly.yaml** file is the most flexible way of providing arguments.
Please use it to provide arguments that are common for all the commands, for a specific command, or for a specific API.
It could be used for providing arguments for both **cli** and **core** packages.
Please refer to the [configuration file](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/configuration/) documentation for more details.

## Exit codes

The application maintains the following exit codes.

| Exit code | Description               |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| 0         | Success                   |
| 1         | Command execution error   |
| 2         | Config resolution failure |

## Tests

When running tests, make sure the code is compiled (`npm run compile`).
Having `redocly.yaml` in the root of the project affects the unit tests, and console logs affect the e2e tests, so make sure to get rid of both before running tests.
Run `npm test` to start both unit and e2e tests (and additionally typecheck the code).

### Unit tests

Run unit tests with this command: `npm run unit`.

Unit tests in the **cli** package are sensitive to top-level configuration file (**redocly.yaml**).

To run tests from a single file, run: `npm run unit -- <path/to/your/file.test.ts>`
To run a specific test, use this command: `npm run unit -- -t 'Test name'`.
To update snapshots, run `npm run unit -- -u`.

### E2E tests

Run e2e tests with this command: `npm run e2e`.

E2E tests are sensitive to any additional output (like `console.log`) in the source code.

To update snapshots, run `npm run e2e -- -u`.

If you made any changes, make sure to compile the code before running the tests.

The e2e tests are written and run with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).
Most of them are encapsulated inside the `commands.test.ts` file.
However, when adding new e2e tests, it's best to follow the approach of the `respect` command tests.

Note that the snapshot does not always match the command output because of the way the stdout and stderr outputs are combined in tests.

Here's how the output is processed in tests:

```typescript
const out = result.stdout ? result.stdout.toString() : '';
const err = result.stderr ? result.stderr.toString() : '';
return `${out}\n${err}`;
```

This is intentional behavior to have consistent command outputs where NodeJS handles the output buffering. When writing tests, keep in mind that the order of stdout and stderr messages in the actual output might differ from what you see in the terminal, but the combined output will be consistent for snapshot testing.

### Smoke tests

Smokes are for testing the CLI in different environments.

To run them locally, please follow the steps described in the smoke GitHub actions: [smoke](.github/workflows/smoke.yaml), [smoke-plugins](.github/workflows/smoke-plugins.yaml), [smoke-rebilly](.github/workflows/smoke-rebilly.yaml).

To update smoke tests for the `build-docs` command (which sometimes fails due to external package updates), please follow the steps below:

```sh
# Build and install the current CLI build locally
npm run compile
npm run pack:prepare
npm i -g redocly-cli.tgz

# Re-build the docs
(cd __tests__/smoke/ && redocly build-docs openapi.yaml -o pre-built/redoc.html)
```

For other commands you'd have to do something similar.

### Performance benchmark

To run the performance benchmark locally, you should have `hyperfine` (v1.16.1+) installed on your machine.
Prepare the local build, go to the `benchmark` folder, clean it up, do the preparations, and run the actual benchmark:

```sh
(npm run compile && npm run pack:prepare && cd benchmark/ && git clean -dX -f . && git clean -dX -ff . && npm i && npm run make-test && npm test)
```

You might need to adjust the CLI versions that need to be tested in the `benchmark/package.json` file.

## Release flow

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) flow.
After merging a PR with a changeset, the release PR is automatically created.

If the pipelines are not starting, close and reopen the PR.
Merging that PR triggers the release process.

### Revert a release

There's no possibility to revert a release itself.
However, you can release a new version with a problematic commit reverted.
Create a new branch from **main**, then find the hash of the commit you want to revert and run `git revert <commit-hash>`.
Create a patch-level changeset for the revert and open a PR with it.
Merge the PR and cut a release according to the [Release flow](#release-flow).

### Snapshot release

To release an experimental version to the **NPM** registry, follow these steps:

1. Create a new PR to **main**.
2. Add the `snapshot` label to the PR.
   This triggers a release of the current branch changes to the **NPM** registry under the `snapshot` tag.

The released version can be installed with `npm install @redocly/cli@snapshot`.

### Release a V1 version

Redocly CLI v1 is currently in archive mode, but still can receive bug fixes.

To release a new version, switch to the `v1` branch and follow the steps described in the Contribution guide (the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file).
