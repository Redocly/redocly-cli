# Spot API problems before they stain

## `@redocly/respect-core`

Respect the discrepancies between OpenAPI descriptions and actual API responses.

The key benefits of `respect`:

- Increases clarity and readability of tests.
- Autogenerates tests from OpenAPI to get started quickly.
- Maintain a positive reputation in your ecosystem (nobody likes when a 3rd party API change breaks their own software).
- Efficient because it links API requests to corresponding OpenAPI descriptions automatically.
- Shift left to catch problems fast before they are costly. Run on developer laptops and CICD.

You **MUST** have a working API server running in order to run the tests because it sends real HTTP requests.
