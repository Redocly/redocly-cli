# Redocly CLI

[@Redocly](https://redocly.com) CLI is your all-in-one OpenAPI utility. It builds, manages, improves, and quality-checks your OpenAPI descriptions, all of which comes in handy for various phases of the API Lifecycle. Create your own rulesets to make API governance easy, and publish beautiful API reference documentation. Supports OpenAPI 3.1, 3.0 and OpenAPI 2.0 (legacy Swagger).

## Usage

### Node

```sh
npx @redocly/cli lint path-to-root-file.yaml
```

Alternatively, install it globally with `npm`:

```sh
npm install @redocly/cli -g
```

Then you can use it as `redocly [command] [options]`, for example:

```sh
redocly lint path-to-root-file.yaml
```

Minimal required versions of Node.js and NPM are 14.19.0 and 7.0.0 respectively.

### Docker

To give the Docker container access to the OpenAPI description files, you need to
mount the containing directory as a volume. Assuming the API description is rooted
in the current working directory, you need the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/spec redocly/cli lint path-to-root-file.yaml
```

To build and run with a local image, run the following from the project root:

```sh
docker build -t redocly/cli .
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/spec redocly/cli lint path-to-root-file.yaml
```

## Common tasks

### Generate API reference documentation

Redocly CLI is a great way to render API reference documentation. It uses open source [Redoc](https://github.com/redocly/redoc) to build your documentation. Use a command like this:

```sh
redocly build-docs openapi.yaml
```

Your API reference docs are in `redoc-static.html` by default. You can customize this in many ways. [Read the main docs](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/commands/build-docs) for more information.

> :bulb: Redocly also has [hosted API reference docs](https://redocly.com/docs/api-registry/guides/api-registry-quickstart/), a (commercial) alternative to Redoc. Both Redoc and Redocly API reference docs can be worked on locally using the `preview-docs` command.

### Bundle multiple OpenAPI documents

Having one massive OpenAPI description can be annoying, so most people split them up into multiple documents via `$ref`, only to later find out some tools don't support `$ref`, or don't support multiple documents?! Well fear not, because Redocly has a `bundle` command you can use to recombine all of those documents back into one single document. The bundled output Redocly CLI provides is clean, tidy, and looks like a human made it.

### Automate API guidelines with Linting

Check your API matches the expected API guidelines by using the `lint` command. API guidelines are an important piece of API governance, it helps to keep APIs consistent (enforcing the same standards and naming conventions) but can also guide API teams through potential security hazards and other pitfalls. Automating API guidelines means you can keep APIs consistent and secure throughout their lifecycle. Even better, you can shape the design of the API before it even exists if you combine API linting with a design-first API workflow!

Our API linter is designed for speed on even large documents, and it's easy to run locally, in CI, or anywhere you need it. It's also designed for humans, with meaningful error messages to help you get your API right every time.

Try it like this:

```sh
redocly lint openapi.yaml
```

**Configure the rules** as you wish. Other API Linters use complicated identifiers like JSONPath, but Redocly makes life easy with simple expressions that understand the OpenAPI structure. You can either use the [built-in rules](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/rules) to mix-and-match your ideal API guidelines, or break out the tools to build your own.

**Format the output** in whatever way you need, the `stylish` output is as good as it sounds, but if you need JSON or Checkstyle outputs to integrate with other tools, the lint command can output those too.

**Multiple files supported** so you don't need to bundle your API description to lint it, just point Redocly CLI at the "entry point" (e.g.: `openapi.yaml`) and it handles the rest.

### Transform an OpenAPI description

If your OpenAPI description isn't everything you hoped it would be, enhance it with the Redocly [decorators](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/decorators) feature. This allows you to:

- Publish reference docs with a subset of endpoints for public use
- Improve the docs by adding examples and descriptions
- Adapt an existing OpenAPI description, and replace details like URLs for use on staging platforms

## Data collection

This tool [collects data](./docs/usage-data.md) to help Redocly improve our products and services. You can opt out by setting the `REDOCLY_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `off`.
