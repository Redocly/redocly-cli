## Features

Currently, @redocly/cli supports these features:

- [x] Multi-file validation. No need to bundle your file before validation.

- [x] Built-in rules for common validations.
- [x] Configurable severity levels for each rule.
- [x] Human-readable error messages with codeframes and stylish format options.
- [x] Intuitive suggestions for misspelled types or references.
- [x] Easy to implement custom rules.
- [x] Bundle a multi-file definition into a single file.
- [x] Decorators to modify a validated definition during bundling.
- [x] Preview docs for local development.
- [x] Support for OpenAPI 2 (fka Swagger) and OpenAPI 3.0.
- [x] Basic support for OpenAPI 3.1

## What makes this tool different

- üí® **It's faster** (uses a type tree similar to how linters for programming languages work)
- üéØ **It's more accurate** (working with types is more accurate than working with JSON path)
- ‚öôÔ∏è **It's highly configurable** (comes with a lot of commands and rules)
- üõ†Ô∏è **It's more extensible** (architected for custom plugins and types)

## Usage

### Node

```
npx @redocly/cli lint path-to-root-file.yaml
```

Alternatively, install it globally with `npm`:

```
npm install @redocly/cli -g
```

Then you can use it as `redocly [command] [options]`, for example:

```redocly lint path-to-root-file.yaml```

### Docker

To give the Docker container access to the OpenAPI definition files, you need to
mount the containing directory as a volume. Assuming the OAS definition is rooted
in the current working directory, you need the following command:

```
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/spec redocly/cli lint path-to-root-file.yaml
```

To build and run with a local image, run the following from the project root:

```
docker build -t redocly/cli .
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/spec redocly/cli lint path-to-root-file.yaml
```
